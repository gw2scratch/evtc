## [arcdps Log Manager](ArcdpsLogManager)

A manager for arcdps EVTC logs. Filter logs, upload them with one click, find fastest kills and interesting statistics.

- Filter logs by time, encounter, success/failure
- Quickly see the composition, players, encounter duration for any log
- Upload to dps.report with one click, batch uploads
- A table of all players in your currently filtered logs
- A table of all guilds within your currently filtered logs

## [EVTC Inspector](EVTCInspector)
A program for exploring EVTC logs. Handy when developing anything that analyzes logs.

- browse through raw combat items
- browse through raw agent data
- browse through processed events, with filtering
- browse through agents and events they are involved in

## [EVTC Analytics](EVTCAnalytics)
The core library for parsing and analyzing EVTC logs. Built with integration
in other projects in mind. Currently has a somewhat API, changes are to be expected.

- get raw agent, skill and combat item data from logs
- get agents and processed events with structured data
- get encounter results
- calculate statistics such as DPS, buff uptimes and similar (very work-in-progress)

There is [documentation](https://gw2scratch.github.io/evtc/master/) available.
